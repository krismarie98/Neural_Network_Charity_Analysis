# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis is to use neural networks to predict which organization will be succesful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Once the initial machine learning model is set up, we attempted to create different model in order to get a higher accuracy score.
## Results:
### Data Preprocessing:
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The variable that is considered a target for this model is the column "Is Successful."
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The variables that are considered to be features for this model are application types, affiliations, ask amount, special considerations, income amount, status, organizations, use cases, and classifications. Each of these columns were further broken down into separate columns to represent the diferent answers.
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The two columsn that were removed from the data set were the EIN columns and the name columns. This is because they did not add value to the question posed.
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
